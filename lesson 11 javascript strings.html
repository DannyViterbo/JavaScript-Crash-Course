        //strings are behind the scence arrays. 25 diff string functions.  basically name of the string and the name of method you wanna work on.  ie. string is names airline and methond is to bring together, so you concat.  if the method is to find out what letter is the in (ie) 5th postion use charAt(4) function.  for the uniform code for that letter use charCodeAt
